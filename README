SkyBlue CMS version 2.0 is the second generation of the SkyBlueCanvas lightweight CMS. Before downloading this code, be sure you understand the following:

- The code is not quite finished and is not ready for production web sites. 
- You will need substantial PHP and debugging skills to get the code working.
- It does work, but the set-up requires advanced PHP skills
- You will also need decent command-line and Linux skills
- Support from the developer will be minimal due to time constraints but I will make an effort to help serious developers who want to contribute to the project
