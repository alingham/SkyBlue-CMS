SkyBlue CMS version 2.0 is the second generation of the SkyBlueCanvas lightweight CMS. Before downloading this code, be sure you understand the following:

- The code is not quite finished and is not ready for production web sites. 
- You will need substantial PHP and debugging skills to get the code working.
- It does work, but the set-up requires advanced PHP skills
- You will also need decent command-line and Linux skills
- Support from the developer will be minimal due to time constraints but I will make an effort to help serious developers who want to contribute to the project


Set-up:

It is important to note that the root of the SkyBlue code is not the web root. For security, the web root is /skyblue/webroot/. If http://yoursite.com currently points to /var/www/html/, the htaccess.txt file, when modifed per the instructions below, should redirect requests to http://yoursite.com to /var/www/html/skyblue/webroot/. This is done so the majority of the executable PHP files are outside the web path. Follow the instructions below to get started.

- Download SkyBlue to your web server. 
- Unzip/untar the download into your web server root. For instance, on Linux this will probably be something like /var/www/html. Place the un-compressed SkyBlue source code folder in this directory.
- Open htaccess.txt in a text editor
- Search/replace skybluecanvas.com with your web URL
- Save the file to .htaccess
- Once you have SkyBlue up and running, log into the admin by going to http://yoursite.com/admin.php. The default login credentials are:

username: admin
password: admin
